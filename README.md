# machine-learning

This repository contains all of my work on Machine Learning.

In it, one will find all the projects from the Machine Learning nanodegree program from Udacity which I graduated as well as my own research on Deep Reinforcement Learning which includes my implementations of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Actor Critic (A3C) algorithms on Tensorflow.
